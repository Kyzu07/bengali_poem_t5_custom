# T5-based Bengali Poetry Generation

## Overview

This repository hosts a T5-based model trained on the complete poem collection of Kazi Nazrul Islam. The primary goal is to generate poetic content inspired by the unique style and themes found in Nazrul's poetry from a given topic.

## Project Highlights

- **Dataset:**
  - Utilized the complete poem collection of Kazi Nazrul Islam as the training dataset.

- **Data Preprocessing:**
  - Applied specific Bengali text data preprocessing tailored to poetry.

- **Model Architecture:**
  - T5-based architecture for sequence-to-sequence learning.

- **Training:**
  - Trained the model on a substantial dataset for poetry generation.

## Data Preprocessing

In the process of preparing the dataset for training the T5-based model, several key preprocessing steps were applied:

- **Unicode Normalization:**
  - Ensured uniformity by normalizing Unicode characters to their standard forms.

- **Removing Special Characters:**
  - Eliminated non-alphanumeric characters, punctuation, and symbols while preserving poetic expressions.

- **Stopword Handling:**
  - Managed stopwords in a way that respects the poetic nature of the dataset.

These preprocessing steps contribute to the generation of coherent and stylistically faithful poetry.
